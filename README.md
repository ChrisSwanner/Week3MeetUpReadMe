# Predict the oscars using data science meetup #
## Date : 3/1/2018 ##

# Coordinated by Thinkful Portland and help at the wework offices #
## The event was formatted like a small lecture, our speaker presented a small lesson on the basics of data collection and how you can then take your data and use it for data science. This topic was very interesting to me, statistics and probability are much more interesting topics than I would have first thought. Being able to bring real world data into a program or model you have built, and then manipulate it to get results is an incredible use of technology. The most interesting part of this meet up for me was one specific point the speaker made. He told a story about he and one of his previous teams, and a model that they had built to be able to predict the oscars. They used this program to predict the 2017 oscars, and their program returned La La Land as the winner for best picture. When the results first came out they were thrilled to hear that the movie had won because their model worked. Shortly after, the news hat Moonlight had instead won the award was released. This outcome did not discredit the prediction though, because the model had still given Moonlight a 13% chance of winning. By winning it proved the nature of probability and chance.

## My main take away from this poinnt is an increase interest in machine learning. The ability to be able to manipulate real world data sets and use them to predict future events is very impressive. It made me being to think about more practical real life uses of machine learning aside from predictings the oscars. In alost every job field there is a clear benefit in the form of risk assessment. In any large corporation there are risks and losses, but if you took advantage of a model that could be fed previous years sales, risk, statistics etc.. you could then turn around and make reasonable assumptions about risky decisions in the future. ##

## I think that it was a very well planned out lesson. The only thing I think would have been more helpful is if there had been more available data sets and decisions trees to view. There was not much of a chance for us to write much of our own code, but instead we observed the speaker writing it out and explaining as he went, which worked, but could have been improved. The event was open to everyone regardless of coding ability so that would be the main reason they decided to leave out more hands on learning in python for the time being.

## With that feedback in mind I would recommend going and being a part of either another machine learning meet up or a meet up that you feel more suits your interest. Even if it is not something that directly relates to your desired job path, there is very valuabable take aways that you would not have recieved otherwise.
