# Predict the oscars using data science meetup #
## Date : 3/1/2018 ##

# Coordinated by Thinkful Portland and help at the wework offices #
## The event was formatted like a small lecture, our speaker presented a small lesson on the basics of data collection and how you can then take your data and use it for data science ##

#The main topic of the event was how you can use real world data to be able to predict future events #
## This meetup interested me because statistics and probability were always very interesting to me. Being able to bring real world data into a program and manipulate it to get results is a fantastic use of the technology ##

# The best part of the event was a point in the lecture where our speaker was explaining how even in cases where there is one choice that is obviously the most probable, there is still a large chance another choice can occur, just because of the nature of chance. He used an example where he and his team used his program to predict the 2017 oscars, and their program returned La La Land as the winner for best picture. When the results first came out they were thrilled to hear that the movie had won because it proved that it had worked. Shortly after though, they heard that moonlight had actually won the oscar for best picture. He said that after hearing that the program he had worked so hard on had been wrong, it actually still proved the function of the program to be correct. It had predicted that Moonlight had a 13% chance of winning that award, and by winning it proved the nature of probability and chance. #
## My main take away from this meet up was an increased interest in machine learning, and the more complex programs the speaker described. Being able to give a program a data set, and then being able to manipulate that data set into a practical model for real world use is fantastic to me. It made me think about the more practical uses of machine learning aside from predicting the oscars. In almost every job field I can see it's benefit, for example, in any large corporation there are risks and losses, but if you took advantage of a program that could be fed previous years sales and statistics, you could then turn around and make reasonable assumptions about risky decisions in the future with the help of that program. ##

#Feedback : I think the event was put on very well. The only thing that I think would have helped even more is if there had been more available data sets and code to view. There was not much of a chance for us to write much of the code ourselves, but instead we observed the speaker writing it out and explaining as he went, which worked, but could have been improved. The event was open to everyone regardless of coding ability so that would be the main reason they decided to leave out more hands on learning. #
## With that feedback in mind I would 100% recommend going and being a part of either another machine learning meet up or something close. Even if it is not a path you would like to take, there is very valuable knowledge about real world data and how that is collected. ##
